Deepwolf mech; 
Named for a species of spiritually significant creature native to Jak's homeworld of Obsidian, the chassis seeks to emulate the adaptability and ferocious cunning of its namesake. Built from the ground up with revolutions and insurgent work in mind, it can function solo using its deployables as force multipliers and attacking from positions of strength, but the mech truly shines when deployed as part of a group, using its ambush predator camo system to wait and ready its weapons, working in concert with allies to lure unwitting foes into the waiting jaws of a trap, before striking with devastating force, ushering another unfortunate enemy to the depths.  

JakAl Cometwerks, keeping in mind the often clandestine nature of insurgent work, has taken great pains to make the license files for this machine extremely compressed and nearly untraceable, making for easy delivery and deployment of the files once they arrive, able to be printed traditionally, or fed into a mining exo directly, which will begin to change and reforge itself accordingly, given access to a small minimum of raw material to work with.
